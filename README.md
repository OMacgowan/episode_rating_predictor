Example Description

The frequency of dialogue By characters, and between characters in a show, as well as the tone of this dialogue (ie exclamatory dialogue) plays a huge role in determining the feel, emotion, and plot itself of a film/tv show. These factors among other things, greatly impact not only the story being told, but the perception of it by its viewer, and its perception of quality by its rater.

Within our midterm project we looked at the well known tv show FRIENDS, and we found correlations existed between frequency of dialogue and exclamatory dialogue by certain main characters, and the rating of the episode it occured in, as well as finding a relationship between the viewership size of the episode it occured in.

For our final project, we wanted to build on this idea:

One of us had recently been watching the show, and noticed, the show commonly brought on Celebrities to feature as "non main characters" for an episode or two, and he had wondered, what impact the participation of such background characters interacting with the larger show had on its audience perception.

So, In addition to furthering our look into dialogue and exclamatory dialogue (we consider text in upper case, or containing excalamation marks exclamatory) by the main characters, we also wanted to see, and model whether a relationship exists, between the collective dialogue, and collective exclamatory dialogue of the non-main characters, on the critics and viewers perception of the episode they belong to.
