The frequency of dialogue by characters, as well as the tone of this dialogue (e.g., exclamatory dialogue), plays a significant role in shaping the emotional tone, feel, and plot of a film or TV show. These factors, among others, not only influence the story being told but also affect how viewers perceive it and how it is rated.

In our midterm project, we analyzed the well-known TV show Friends and found correlations between the frequency of dialogue and exclamatory dialogue by certain main characters and the rating of the episodes in which they appeared. We also discovered a relationship between the size of the episodeâ€™s viewership and the frequency of these dialogues.

For our final project, we wanted to expand on this idea. One of us had been watching the show and noticed that Friends often featured celebrities as "non-main characters" for an episode or two. This sparked the question of how the participation of these background characters and their interactions with the main cast influenced audience perception.

In addition to further investigating the dialogue and exclamatory dialogue of the main characters (where we consider text in uppercase or containing exclamation marks as exclamatory), we aimed to model the relationship between the collective dialogue and exclamatory dialogue of non-main characters and the critics' and viewers' perceptions of the episodes they appear in.
